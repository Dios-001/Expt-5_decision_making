# Algorithms

## Vowel Consonant Checker

### Algorithm

1. **Start.**  
2. **Initialize:** Declare a `char` variable `letter`.
3. **Input:** Take a letter as input from the user and store it in the `letter` variable.
4. **Decision Making:**  
   - If the letter is one of `a, e, i, o, u` (either uppercase or lowercase), print:  
     **"The character is a vowel."**  
   - Else, print:  
     **"The character is a consonant."**
5. **End.**


## Introduction

These programs are designed to help you practice essential programming skills in C++. They cover a range of basic operations, including arithmetic, comparison, character checking, and conditional statements.

## Program 1: Basic Calculator

### Logic Explanation

This program implements a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The steps are:

1. **User Input**: The user inputs two numbers and selects an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
2. **Perform Operation**: The program performs the selected arithmetic operation.
3. **Display Result**: The result of the operation is displayed to the user.

## Program 2: Find the Largest of Three Numbers

### Logic Explanation

This program finds the largest of three numbers entered by the user. The logic includes:

1. **User Input**: The user inputs three numbers.
2. **Comparison**: The program compares the three numbers to determine the largest one.
3. **Output Result**: The largest number is displayed.

## Program 3: Vowel Check

### Logic Explanation

This program checks if a given character is a vowel. The steps are:

1. **User Input**: The user inputs a character.
2. **Vowel Check**: The program checks if the character is one of the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') and considers both uppercase and lowercase.
3. **Output Result**: The program outputs whether the character is a vowel or not.

## Program 4: Determine Weekday from Number

### Logic Explanation

This program determines the day of the week based on a number from 1 to 7. The steps are:

1. **User Input**: The user inputs a number between 1 and 7.
2. **Determine Day**: The program maps the number to a corresponding day of the week (e.g., 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, etc.).
3. **Output Result**: The corresponding day is displayed.

## Program 5: Even or Odd Check

### Logic Explanation

This program checks whether a given number is even or odd. The steps are:

1. **User Input**: The user inputs a number.
2. **Check Even or Odd**: The program checks if the number is divisible by 2 (even) or not (odd).
3. **Output Result**: The result (even or odd) is displayed.
